## Who am I?

This is a personal blog of
[Santeri Paavolainen](https://github.com/santtu). As is evident in
what I write about I have a deep interest in software development and
cloud computing. Professionally I work also (probably more) on project
management and strategic technology consulting.

Apart from this blog you can find more about me at these services:

* [github.com/santtu](https://github.com/santtu)
* [twitter.com/paavolainen](https://twitter.com/paavolainen)
* [linkedin.com/in/paavolainen](http://fi.linkedin.com/in/paavolainen)
* [santtu@iki.fi](email:santtu@iki.fi)

I do independent consulting on cloud computing at both strategic
business level ("why and how") and engineering level ("what and
when"). If you are interested in the benefits I can provide for your
organization, [please do be in touch](email:santtu@iki.fi).
