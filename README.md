This is my blog hosted at [santtu.iki.fi](http://santtu.iki.fi/) â€”
please head out there to read the posts in a nicer format.

It uses [Jekyll Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com) and [GitHub
Pages](http://pages.github.com/) so if you are interested in a way to
create a blog (or a custom site) using GitHub as storage and hosting
platform, give them a spin!
