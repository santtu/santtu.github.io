It's been a while since my last blog post — not that I don't have many
ideas, but too little time — and I decided to do something different
this time. A deviation from the very technical blog posts I normally
do.

I am going to talk about **Finnish sauna and its significance in
Finnish culture**. This is also a topical writing since now is the eve
of eve of Christmas ("aatonaatto" in finnish, well the publish time
might shift to eve, but that's not when I'm writing this) as **sauna**
is also a very important part of Finnish Christmas.

Also, I'm not even trying to do a logical blog post. Instead I'll opt
to just write about many topics, one topic at a time, without
necessarily any kind of cohesive story between the topics. I'll also
mostly skip the history of sauna — feel free to browse the net or look
into books and research articles yourself.

## Words

**Sauna** is the place where there's a **kiuas**, which is a stove
full of exposed rocks, and is used to heat the sauna (methods of
heating vary). There are raised wooden benches within the sauna to sit
on.

**Saunoa** is the act of **being in a heated sauna** for the purpose
of ... well, being in a hot sauna. (If you sit in a *cold* sauna you
are just being an ass.)

**Löyly** is the result of throwing water on the hot rocks in the
*kiuas*. Yep, *löyly* is essentially 100+℃ steam resulting from
instant vaporization of water when it meets rocks heated to several
hundred degrees centigrade.

## Types of saunas

**Electrically heated** sauna (e.g. the kiuas has electric heating
elements within) is the most common. It is pretty difficult to use any
other kind of heating method in modern apartments for various strange
reasons such as fire safety and ventilation, so, it's the most common.

Note that an electrically heated sauna is considered also to be the
**worst** of all of the options. (But it's like sex — a bad sauna is
way better than having no sauna at all.)

**Wood-heated** sauna is. Well. The rocks are heated using burned
wood. Pretty self-explanatory, I think.

> don't get that hot, they have temperature regulators and
> heat-sensitive fuses.)

**Savusauna** is an older form of wood-heated sauna which **has no
chimney**. Wood results in smoke, and no chimney plus smoke equals
smoke in the whole sauna. This may sound like a bit crazy, but the
real secret is that this is definitely **the most super extra best
type of sauna experience you can have**. (Why these are not common?
See next.)

**Burned-down sauna** is another type of traditional wood-fired
sauna. Hey, think about it. You have a fire, which heats rocks, which
can get **very** hot, and heating a sauna takes anything from 30
minutes to a few hours depending on the type which means that it is
going to be left unattended. Fire hazard, anyone?

There are **very few** old historical saunas in Finland. Wood-fired
saunas **just do not last**. It is practically a tradition in Finland
to burn down a sauna every now and then. (Which is also another reason
why wood-heated saunas are usually located in detached buildings.)

## Who go to a sauna

Everybody.

I mean, in the demographical sense. "Liking" sauna is a continuum and
not even all finns like or go to sauna. But apart from this funny
little minority **everybody** in Finland go to a sauna more or less
regularly.

Like, the president, adults, children, teens, retirees, very very old
people, people with heart conditions, pregnant women, men, women,
mythical beasts ... everybody!

> My own children started getting into sauna about as soon as they
could crawl (yes, getting into, not taken into). Typically small
children stay in for shorter periods of time and/or sit on lower
benches, but still, even babies often go to a sauna in Finland. Even
my 4 year old kid is sitting on the topmost bench nowadays.

(If you haven't been into a sauna, and ever get a chance, keep that in
your mind: 4 year old kid, 70+℃ sauna, topmost bench — don't you dare
to shirk.)

## Mixed gender saunas and sex

True and not true.

First, a sauna in Finnish tradition is a place of cleanliness and
purification. No sex in sauna, please (excluding the caveats, of
course). Also there's hardly any stud that can do the required
hydraulic moves while the environment is 70+℃ without risking a heart
attack. Also staring at any dangling things of other people is just as
bad manners in sauna as anywhere else.

Secondly, yes, there are mixed gender saunas. Families typically go to
saunas together — yep, Finnish kids will see their parents and
siblings naked regularly, probably one of the reasons there's less
hangups around here about nudity than in some other places. (But half
of that is probably generic Nordic mindset, Swedes and Norwegians
don't have as much saunas and they're pretty relaxed as well.)

In non-familial situations such as with friends or colleagues having a
sauna it is possible to have women-only and mixed shifts. Which means
that if you are a foreign female, it's okay to ask for a women-only
shift as it is considered rude to force women to a mixed-gender
sauna. But don't **assume** that separate sauna shifts are the default
as most finns **just do not see sauna as a place of sexuality** and it
is just as common to default having mixed gender saunas in a company
of friends.

## Where are saunas?

Everywhere in Finland.

* Houses. Almost 100% of single-family houses have **at least one
  sauna**. A significant portion of them have an internal electric
  sauna *and* a separate detached wood-heated one.
* Apartments. Most new apartments have a per-apartment sauna, and
  those that don't have a shared sauna in the building available for
  residents on a reservation or a schedule basis.
* Summer cottages. Why have a summer cottage without a sauna in
  Finland? Madness.
* Office buildings. **Yes**, most office buildings have a
  *edustussauna* ("sauna for promotional purposes") that is available
  for companies located in the office building.
* Schools (well, not the modern ones, but older ones yes.)
* Well-equipped gyms.
* and many other places

## Why go to a sauna?

On an individual level,

* It is relaxing. Veeeeerrrry nice for aching muscles.
* After a while in sauna the dead skin layer gets soft and you can
  just scrape the topmost dirty layer off. It *does* feel very nice
  afterwards. Some people attribute the skin quality of Finnish girls
  to sauna, but I'm not so sure. (Or it doesn't work with males at
  all.)
* A *kova löyly* (throwing a lot of water on the stones for extra hot
  *löyly*) makes the skin prickle in the heat. It feels like your skin
  is burning, but if you just persevere a little ... it's not actually
  going to burn ... your body will release a hit of endorphins.

  You know endorphins? Body's own opioids. Feelgood. Veryfeelgood.
* Especially in wintertime staying outdoors often makes you feel
  cold. I guess if you are like, a canadian, you know what I mean. Not
  the cold where you are *freezing to death* (literally), but the kind
  where you are not really cold, but still somehow your bones are
  feeling the cold.

  Solution: sauna. After outdoors I ask the kids "want to go to sauna
  to warm up?" the answer is "yay!".
* Sitting outdoors after a sauna. See below.

It's not necessarily all of these. Sometimes I heat up the sauna
because I didn't stretch too well after a workout and the next day I
got aches. Then I just strech down on the bench in the warmth and not
even throw water on the kiuas.

On a group level, going to a sauna is often a **social**
occasion. "Let's have a sauna" is a potential substitute in Finland
between friends to "let's go have a pint". Social events are often
arranged as sauna events (often with food and drinks, and actually
going to the sauna is **not** compulsory, so if you ever get an
invitation to a company sauna event it's okay to actually not go into
the sauna).

## *apres-sauna*

Sitting outdoors, on a bench, with a drink in hand, clothed only in a
towel, after a sauna is a trope of Finnish sauna culture. You do that
when:

* It's a warm evening in the summer.
* It's a freezing night in the winter. (And anywhere in between.)

Sounds crazy? It's not, for two reasons. The empirical reason is that
in both cases you'll get dry. I mean, really dry, pretty fast, as if
you had gone through a dryer. The best part of this is that **even in
the freezing winter** it takes quite a lot of time until you'll start
feeling the cold. Second? Physics.

> Physics alert! When you move from sauna to a colder environment

The result is that you can go from a sauna to a -20℃ outdoors and sit
comfortably, sipping a beer, for several minutes until you feel any
kind of cold. (Provided it is not windy and you don't have to rest
your feet on a cold surface. Feet, cold, bad.)

Regardless, it is a pleasurable experience.

## Sauna etiquette

Shower or take a dip in the lake before you go into sauna.

Don't wear swimsuit in a sauna. If you do you'll get a funny look, but
being a foreigner you'll be excuded. Still, it's not proper etiquette.

If you throw water on *kiuas*, **you don't get out** before others or
until it has cooled down. It's the principle of "you caused it, you
suffer it."

*There are a lot more* etiquette rules, but those are quite a bit more
nuanced. Probably in the category of Japanese tea seremony — only a
few major rules, but a lifetime to master wholly.

## Christmas sauna

Finns take a sauna on Christmas eve. Whether this is a christian
tradition (you know, purification for receiving the birth of the
Christ) or something even older is not something I want really to
comment on. It is a tradition. It was a tradition in my childhood
home, in my grandmother's home, and several generations before that,
and I'm carrying it on myself.

I mentioned earlier that not all apartments have saunas. With shared
saunas special holidays are usually handled so that there is a common
saunas for all residents (men and women shifts separated) on most
important holidays such as Christmas eve and midsummer's eve
(sometimes also easter).

## Heat

Common sauna dry air temperature is somewhere from 70 to 90 degrees
centigrade. It is possible to have 100-120℃ dry air temperature,
although it gets a little harsh (not because of the air temperature,
but because it requires a very hot *kiuas*, and a very hot *kiuas*
results in a very harsh *löyly*, which generally is not
preferable).

Don't be alarmed, you won't boil in a 110℃ sauna. Dry air is a bad
conductor of heat. The same principle makes tropics feel much more
stuffy than dry deserts.
