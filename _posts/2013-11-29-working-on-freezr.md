Just a quick post â€” I'm working now on something I call *freezr*. It
is is a) a hobby project and b) based on a real world need. Since it's
a hobby project it is also naturally an open source project (or at
least will be when I get around tacking license information into the
repository) and located, of course at
[GitHub](https://github.com/santtu/freezr).
