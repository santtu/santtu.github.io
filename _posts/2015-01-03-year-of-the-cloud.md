It is the time of the year that people are trying to fill the
intellectual void caused by overabudance of eggnog, glögg and premium
chocolate by producing *predictions for the coming year 2015*. I'm not
much of a seer, so instead I'll take a look at the past year 2014 and
produce some probably blindingly obvious tautologies.

A lot happened in 2014 in the cloud
market. [This happened](http://msopentech.com/blog/2014/06/09/docker-on-microsoft-azure/),
[then](http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/10/google-bets-big-on-docker-with-app-engine-integration-open-source-container-management-tool/)
[and](http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/cloud-container-management/)
[also](http://techcrunch.com/2014/11/04/google-launches-managed-service-for-running-docker-based-applications-on-its-cloud-platform/). Docker
this, docker that. Also,
[AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2014/),
[Azure](http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/) and
[Google](http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/2015/01/2014-Year-in-Review-Bringing-a-team-together-to-help-you-best.html)
announced quite a lot of new features, services, bells and whistles.

It is also interesting to see that cloud vendors are willing to
[cut](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-price-reduction-42-ec2-s3-rds-elasticache-and-elastic-mapreduce/)
[their](http://www.itworld.com/article/2831972/cloud-computing/google-revamps-enterprise-cloud-services-with-price-cuts--more-features.html)
[prices](http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/03/31/microsoft-azure-innovation-quality-and-price/)
[again](http://googlecloudplatform.blogspot.com/2014/10/Announcing-across-the-board-price-cuts-on-Compute-Engine.html)
and
[again](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/azure-pricing-updates/)
and again and again. I remember someone commenting on Twitter at
re:Invent 2012 about AWS's price reductions, like, that a 30% price
drop is not normal in a competed market. *Or similar*.

I took that to mean that in a mature competed market like electricity,
seeing major price reductions on the baseline price is not possible
because **there are no such margins** in already-furiously-competed
prices. Just the fact that cuts are happening means the market has not
matured into a (semi)stable state.

That's not much of a news in itself — "the cloud" is a shift in the
[landscape itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okqLxzWS5R4) and
only a fool would expect stability right now.

Similarly only a fool would expect cloud market evolution to be a
re-run of something that
[has](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer#History)
[happened](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft#1992.E2.80.931995:_Domination_of_the_corporate_market)
[before](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars). Expecting the
past to be a play of the future is
[bound to fail](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-conventional-wisdom-on-oil-is-always-wrong/).

The problem I see in 2014 is that it bought faster and faster chaos
and complexity into the cloud market. I'll try to explain:

**Chaos** is unpredictability, not randomness. All of the cloud
vendors are what economics call *rational players* in the market and
try to make *optimal choices* at any point of time. But this
decision-making process is not visible to *customers*, so although
customers and we, the Internet pundits can find *post hoc* narrative
to all of these events they remain, at heart, *unpredictable* to us.

> It is easy to predict that AWS, Google and Microsoft would drop
their prices in 2015. So what? That's just extrapolating past into
future. Try predicting instead **how much**, **how many times** and
**when** those price drops will occur. And who would be brave enough
to predict that **no price cuts** would occur? Or even **price
increases**? Anyone? Volunteers? (See
[here](http://blog.gardeviance.org/2014/08/keynes-vs-hayek.html).)

**Complexity** … it is not enough that there are more cloud services,
and these are more and more *complicated* but there are also more and
more interactions between different systems leading to
*complexity*. Complexity in turn easily leads to *a priori*
unpredictable emergent and even chaotic behavior — again a problem
especially for larger enterprises, but also for nimbler companies
overreaching their capacity to handle emergent surprises.

Rapid change, chaos and complexity can cause havoc even before a
single line of code is laid
out. [*Analysis paralysis*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis)
is always a real risk, with new stuff continuously popping into
existence, potentially invalidating prior analyses is not helping
planning-oriented organizations. Strategically, if you are not
[keeping an eye on the landscape](http://blog.gardeviance.org/2014/11/fools-mate-in-business.html)
your earlier assumptions about technological barriers of entry could
be invalidated catching you unawares, hurting or obliterating your
business case.

Usually you'd want to take a step up the abstraction layer when this
kind of rapid chaotic evolution occurs to allow one to maintain an
overview without losing too much of the necessary details, but I'm not
sure it is yet possible. At least I feel not. I don't personally have
a useful abstraction at hand yet.

I'm seeing fragmentation of competence and skills for cloud
consultants and engineers in 2015. At least for myself, as a sort of
generalist bridging engineering and business strategy I see *difficult
choices ahead*. Should I choose specialization into some part of the
cloud landscape (technology or business-wise), or raising in the
abstraction level?

Unfortunately the specialization path feels uncomfortably like 90's
fragmentation into different client-server camps and 00's
fragmentation into different web service full stack compositions. I
didn't like either of those when they occurred, mostly as it led to
entrenched us-or-them positioning in the competence market. (Hardly
benefiting customers.) Worst of all, now there's a possibility of this
fragmentation occurring *within* cloud service catalogues — Lambda
vs. Beanstalk battle anyone? Even when AWS positions these as
complementary, the growing service portfolio makes it harder and
harder to have generalists on staff, leading (human nature and all
that) into different specialization camps fighting for their
viewpoints.

Earlier I noted that the abstraction-raising path does not seem to be
open. I could ditch the technology and move purely into *cloud
business strategy* level but that's not what I mean with "going up in
abstractions". It's a different business level with *different*
abstractions, it is not a *new abstraction* for the technology layer
that I'm looking for.

Personally I love working at two levels simultanously, both at the
business and the technology level. It's often difficult and
challenging position, being judged by both camps, but also very
rewarding because you can help customers find solutions that are
beneficial win-win scenarios for all camps and business lines within
the organization. And this of course within the context of cloud
computing for which I have both personal, professional and scientific
interest.

Yet it somehow feels there's a pier and a ship, and I have a leg on
both, and the ship is starting to drift off.
