I've written quite a lot in my life. Some of it has ended up in blogs
(now since gone, although I have archive copies), alas most
not. Mostly what I write is targeted towards a small audience —
customers, co-workers, friends. For those venues a blog isn't actually
the best way (customers like .doc files, for co-workers email or
intranet work just fine, and Facebook and Twitter are great for
friends). Yet, sometimes I have a mysterious urge to spill my guts to
the wider world.

I added a blog to wordpress.com some time earlier, then pulled its
plug without actually writing anything meaningful in there. Somehow I
felt a whole blog site, where I'd worry over presentation (I'm a
stickler for good design) over the content was
somehow.. unsatisfactory. Yet I'd definitely not want to host anything
myself, either.

While this was swirling around my head (in a background process), I
thought about github. It is public. It can natively render
restructuredtext files natively to HTML — perhaps not so pretty, but
what the hell. Thanks got git itself, all of the data would be
version-controlled and securely replicated. Would that work?

So that's what I'm now trying to check out. Could I use github itself
to host a blog, with minimal maintenance and effort?

I do see already some problems. How would you do a nice RSS feed? How
would I do linking between posts easy? And of course, how would I
handle comments?

I'm not sure. I'll find out soon enough.
