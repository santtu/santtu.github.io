I'm currently reading *Cloudonomics* by Joe Weinman. I frequently find
myself nodding in approval as his conclusions either parallel mine or
provide deeper insight into what I've seen when working with and
consulting customers on "the cloud". I'm not through the book yet, but
I do like his insightful and deeply thought out arguments and
counterarguments on what cloud is or is not and how it changes or
might not change companies. Sometimes I mentally argue against
Weinman's conclusions but that's a good thing — the book makes me
think about my own assumptions and views.

Regardless I'm not going to review this book. Go search the Internet
or read it yourself for that. I've got something else.

The opening of chapter 10 got me thinking. Weinman's going through
whether "cloud is like electricity" or "cloud is not like electricity"
and what these differences are — also why we should not extend the
"electricity utility" metaphor too much.

Anyways, I'll quote a short passage (actually a recursive quote, since
it in itself is a quote):

> Security issues in the cloud are very different: As Brynjolfsson
> quipped "No regulatory or law enforcement body will audit a
> company's electrons."

That got me thinking. (If you want the full argument why electrons and
CPU cycles are different, read the book.)

So today's companies cannot differentiate by the **use of computing**,
but by **how** it is used. That is, business practices and models,
which are in turn encoded in software. (If the business model requires
scalability, then scalable software.)

What does this computing make (cloud or no cloud)?

To me it sounds a lot like **grey goo** aka programmable matter aka
utility fog. Okay, computing operates in a virtual reality instead of
physical, but apart from that tiny teeny little difference the basic
idea is the same: both can be programmed to do anything (within some
limitations, within their realm).

Then … If there ever was a
[cornucopia machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_assembler)
(a nanomachine assembler from *Singularity Sky* by Charles Stross)
then what would that mean to businesses?

In the real world some of my purchases are for convenience: instead of
cooking a meal, I eat out. I can cook. I buy a soft drink — I believe
I could look up a recipe, just-and-just construct a CO2 injection
system and if I found some limestone, might even be able to generate
CO2 and liquefy it, but hey, why? <small>(Of course, where would I
get the tubing and machinery to do those... see
[the toaster project](http://www.thetoasterproject.org/page2.htm) on
where this train of thought would lead you.)</small>

Yet while a soft drink might be a borderline case, most of my
purchases are **purchases** not because of convenience but by
necessity. **I do not have the skills or the resources needed to
construct a cell phone or a computer.** Then think how a cornucopia
machine would change that. Recipe for cell phone + cornucopia machine
= new physical cell phone. <small>(Next exercise: think how it **will
be prevented** by legislation and control mechanisms mostly not
because of safety concerns, but because of protection of "intellectual
property". Just like copyright extensions to protect certain exclusive
exploitation rights to a big-eared cartoon mouse.)</small>

Given the proliferation of open source components, cloud services and
software production and operating knowledge
([high scalability](http://highscalability.com/),
[stack overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) etc.) there is less and
less "secret sauce" in how software operates. The difference is more
and more in how software is operated.

Just think all of this, including the cloud, as the equivalent of a
cornucopia machine for virtual reality. You literally can create a
load balancer or a scalable web server cluster out of thin (virtual)
air, with publicly available recipes.

Then what's the big conclusion?

None. I just think there are some conceptual (surprising?)
similarities between the fictional cornucopia machine (smart matter)
concept and now-and-current cloud computing.

Or maybe this: what if real live physical cornucopia machines existed,
how would that affect your business?

Devastate? No effect? Then try the same with a virtual cornucopia
machine, one that can re-create any computing infrastructure from a
recipe. Including yours.

<small>(Note: I'm using the term "infrastructure" in a broad sense
here. I think that any computing service that does not operate in the
"core" of the service, or in the left side of a
[Wardley map](http://blog.gardeviance.org/2014/02/a-wardley-map.html)
is just a *supporting* element — infrastructure. This is a distinction
between "infrastructure" when discussing business vs. technology. In
the business sense Salesforce is infrastructure but in the technology
sense it is software-as-a-service, not
infrastructure-as-a-service. Yes, confusion.)</small>

Of course, an upstart competitor probably will not copy a cranky old
HR or ERM system but will opt for easier to use, easier to deploy
cloud service versions. So instead of copying your computing
infrastructure as-is, think it as someone else making a **better**
copy of it.

Anyway it is summer and I don't think I have any need to be consistent
in this post. Just thinking aloud, pies in the sky etc. etc. :-)
