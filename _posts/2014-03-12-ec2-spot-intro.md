While pondering about whether and why AWS would retire instance types
([see here](/tags.html#instance retirement-ref)) I started looking
more deeply into the [spot instance
market](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/purchasing-options/spot-instances/)
to see if and what it could potentially tell about instance type
retirement.

I started writing one post about the topic. Then I realized it had to
be split into two. And into three. So now I have a series of blog
posts about AWS spot instances and the spot instance market.

I've split these posts into the following topics:

1. [Overview of spot instances and the spot instance market]({% post_url 2014-03-12-ec2-spot-instances %})
2. How to actually use spot instances (in progress)
3. Why spot market exists, where do spot instances come from and what
   drives spot instance prices (in progress)
4. What can the spot market tell about AWS's capacity changes (in progress)

Most of the information I'm going to present is collected from several
sources which themselves have done excellent research and provide
excellent advise for spot instance users. I'll try to give credit to
those sources as far as possible without sacrificing readability of
this piece.

Now, [onwards to the first chapter]({% post_url 2014-03-12-ec2-spot-instances %}).
